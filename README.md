# Jambook - Headless Content First System

**What is Jambook?**

Jambook provides content infrastructure for digital teams to power websites, apps, and devices. Unlike a CMS, Jambook was built to integrate with the modern software stack. It offers a central hub for structured content, powerful management and delivery APIs, and a customizable web app that enable developers and content creators to ship their products faster.

## Getting Started
